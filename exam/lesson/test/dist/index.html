  <h2>5 things we learned during Dwayne Johnson's highly entertaining Instagram live</h2>
    <h3> He's not sure if 'Jungle Cruise' will keep its scheduled release date</h3>
      <p> Johnson and Emily Blunt co-star in the film based on the Disneyland theme park ride, but the actor isn't sure if will keep its July release date in wake of the coronavirus pandemic.<br>"We'll see," he said, adding that its release depends on "if we're able to flatten this curve."Key, he said, is making sure moviegoers "have the emotional confidence to get back into theaters again."<br>Theater chains, shuttered nationwide, have begun some layoffs and furloughing workers in response to their losses.</p>
</div>
<div class="area area15">
  
    <h3> He's got T-Swift on his playlists</h3>
      <p> Questions and comments about Johnson's musical preferences rolled in as "Shake It Off" began playing in the background, but Johnson had no shame in his T-Swift game."Taylor is great," he said. "She's my buddy."<br>As he reminded everyone, Johnson served as the voice of "The Man" in Swift's video for the song of the same name.</p>
    <h3> 'Hobbs & Shaw' sequel update</h3>
      <p> Though not officially announced, Johnson said they are in development for the next installment of his "Fast and the Furious" spin-off.He also expressed his enthusiastic support for the idea for an all-female "Fast and the Furious" spin-off.</p>
   
</div></div>
<div class="area area18">
   <h3> He's obsessed with 'Tiger King' too</h3>
      <p> More proof he's just like us.<br>Johnson admitted to having binge watched Netflix's wildly addicting docuseries about the eccentric characters at the center of America's big cat world. He was so captivated, in fact, that he wanted to buy the film rights to "Tiger King," believing his Seven Bucks Productions outfit could pull together something "special," he said.
Unfortunately, he was too late. <br>Someone else had already snatched them up.
  </p>
    <h3> You can't just Google his french toast recipe</h3>
      <p> While his viewers couldn't smell what The Rock was cooking, they sure did covet it.
Sadly, this recipe isn't available online.Johnson said various chefs have helped evolve the recipe over time and tailor it to his palate. He doesn't like it when his french toast is too heavy or weighted down with creams and butters.<br>"I wanted to dial it back," he said.
He enjoys the "sweet quality" of the brioche bread that serves as the base. Then a mix of "lots of eggs," milk and cinnamon are combined for soaking. It's cooked in a pan with some butter and served in 4-inch thick slices, which he then tops with peanut butter and syrup.That's how you cheat meal, folks.</p>

  <h2> Hulu is not here for your 'Parasite' subtitle complaints</h2>
    <p> The movie made history as the first South Korean film to ever take home an Oscar for best picture when it won in February.
Not to mention all of the critical acclaim.<br>
But the fact that the dialogue is in Korean and the film has English subtitles apparently is bothersome to some.</p>
</div>
<div class="photo area22"></div>
<div class="aspecial area215">
  <p>After a Twitter user recently tweeted "It's not in English, no one wants to watch a movie that they literally have to read to understand what's going on" the official Hulu account clapped back."if you don't want to read subtitles, you can always learn Korean!," a tweet from the Hulu account read.<br>
Hulu is clearly not here for it.
Likewise the film's official Twitter account was not going to stand for it when someone responded to Hulu calling "Parasite" a "pathetic movie.""Or as we like to call it, "BEST PICTURE," a tweet from the "Parasite" movie account read.</p>

  <h2> BTS launching a free concert series</h2>
    <p> Having to postpone their tour isn't going to stop K-pop's biggest group from entertaining.
BTS has announced "Bang Bang Con," a series of their concerts they will be streaming on YouTube starting 11 p.m. ET on April 17.<br>
The ARMY, as the BTS fans are known, can tune into the BANGTANTV YouTube channel to enjoy several of their past concerts including "2015 BTS LIVE: The Most Beautiful Moment in Life On Stage" and "2017 BTS Live Trilogy Episode III The Wings Tour In Seoul."</p>

  <h2> Ryan Reynolds reignites online feud with Hugh Jackman</h2>
  <p> Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman are at it again.<br>It was Reynolds' turn to troll Jackman after the "Wolverine" star posted a loving message to his wife Deborra-Lee Furness for their 24th wedding anniversary.
"These 24 years have been the best of my life! And, as far as I can see, we keep getting better. I love you Debs with every fiber of my soul. Happy anniversary. #24," Jackman posted Saturday, alongside a picture of the two.Reynolds was quick to strike in the comments, writing, "Hang in there, Deb."</p>
</div>

<div class="area area415">
  <p>It was the latest in their ongoing feud. In 2018 Reynolds created a fake ad about Jackman and Jackman responded by letting his dog go to the bathroom on a photo of Reynolds.
In 2019 Reynolds appeared on "Today Show Australia" where he joked that Jackman was "an evil person."<br>
Then they called a truce on Instagram, "Official truce with @realhughjackman!" Reynolds wrote, posting a photo of the two shaking hands. "As a gesture of goodwill, I'm gonna make a beautiful ad for his company, Laughing Man Coffee. Can't wait!"Obviously that didn't last.</p>

  <h2> 'Together at Home' illustrates TV's power to connect us, as rare as that is these days</h2>
    <p> The celebrity response to the coronavirus has generally followed the script of other tragedies. Fundraising concerts, rallying a sense of global connection and patriotism, and seeking to provide rays of uplift and hope.The setting and current circumstances, however, have altered that dynamic, in what has turned out to be a deeply personal way.<br>
On Saturday, the major networks teamed up for Global Citizen's "One World: Together at Home," an event support the fight against Covid-19 and the World Health Organization. Ratings aren't available yet, but the organizers reported that the special generated nearly $128 million in pledged donations.</p>
</div>

<div class="area area513"><div class="photo area552"></div>
  <p>On Thursday, more than 10 million people tuned in for "The Disney Family Singalong," an ABC special in which various stars -- Beyonc√©, Ariana Grande and Demi Lovato among them -- belted out songs from the Disney classics. If the special could be seen in part as a shrewd means of reminding people that you can find all those movies on Disney+, the studio's streaming service, it nevertheless offered a warming note of reassurance at an unsettled time.<br>
The Global Citizen event brought to mind "America: A Tribute to Heroes," a special jointly presented by the networks after the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. Conceived by George Clooney, that program featured not only a star-studded assortment of musical performances but major celebrities manning the phone banks, a symbol that -- at the risk of quoting a song featured in the Disney special -- we're all in this together.</p>
</div>
<div class="area area515">
  <div class="photo area55"></div>
  
  <p>"Together at Home" also contained echoes of Band Aid, Live Aid and "We Are the World" -- a song that has experienced a timely resurgence -- the music industry's collective response in the 1980s to African famine relief, bringing together a who's who of musical acts.
What's different about the latest TV efforts is that they originate from the various performers' homes, a symbol of shared experience as well as the broad swath of fear that the pandemic has already inflicted and the potential extent of its reach.<br>
After all, one of the early names connected with the virus included Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson, a celebrity couple that -- in a sign of the times -- likely made the threat seem real to many at that moment in a way that early statistics on newscasts didn't.
Such heightened intimacy has already been evident as TV pivots into at-home mode, including late night talk shows that are now broadcast from the hosts' homes. The celebrity chat -- usually designed to promote movies or TV shows -- has given way to more sober conversations, while inviting family members (including pets) into the mix.</p>
</div>
<div class="area area518">
  <p>These specials have come at a moment when people are huddled inside their homes, deprived of many of their usual pastimes. Television has always helped people process and deal with tragedy and uncertainty, but seldom with quite so captive an audience.
At the same time, the communal feeling associated with "A Tribute to Heroes" in Sept. 11's wake isn't completely analogous to the climate now. The rally-around-the-flag effect has been blunted, for starters, by intense political polarization and questions about the Trump administration's response to Covid-19.<br>
The age of social media has also fed hostility toward celebrities who don't share one's political views, even as people retweet those who agree with them. Finding points of commonality -- even during a crisis -- has become a more formidable challenge in these tribal times.</p>

<div class="area area520">
  <p>Even so, the current shelter-at-home scenario has temporarily thrown TV back in time a few years. Network ratings are notably up, despite the advent of streaming services and seemingly ubiquitous tide of content.
The sense of togetherness, clearly, has its limits. Content consumption is increasingly a niche-oriented proposition, as people scatter not only to different rooms but their own individual devices to watch entertainment and hear information that speaks narrowly to them.
What we've seen in the last few days, with the Disney and "Together at Home" specials, is that there's still a craving for the feeling of connectedness, of togetherness, that broadcasting has traditionally been uniquely able to provide. It's just that such harmony is less indicative of what is, in normal times, than what was.</p>

  <h2> 'The Last Dance' hits the right notes with its look back at Michael Jordan and the Bulls</h2>
    <p> Instead of a nifty chaser to the NBA Playoffs, "The Last Dance" -- which ESPN moved up by two months -- essentially fills that void, transporting viewers back to the off-court drama, flamboyant personalities and great basketball associated with Michael Jordan and the six-time champion Chicago Bulls. At 10 parts, it's a very, very deep dive, but for fans who will eat this stuff up, it hits all the right notes.</p>
</div>

<div class="area area611">  
  
  <div class="box1">
    <div class="photo a61"></div>
  </div>
  <p> The title refers to the Bulls' final title run in 1998, echoing the preseason handbook that coach Phil Jackson passed out to the team. With general manager Jerry Krause announcing that Jackson wouldn't be back and Jordan saying he would retire if that happened, it was a season-long campaign to put an exclamation point on the squad's greatness.<br>
The documentary series, meanwhile, alternately focuses not just on 1998, but all the previous dances, as well as individual dancers. That means taking extended detours into the lives of Dennis Rodman, Scottie Pippen (one of 12 children) and Jackson.
Still, it's clear who the prima ballerina is here, and now as then, that's Jordan. Notoriously competitive, his tenacity and will to win are spoken of with awe by practically everyone who crossed his path during those years, but the centerpiece is extensive access to the man himself, who displays great candor in discussing his life and legacy.</p>
</div>

<div class="area area613">
  <p>Directed by Jason Hehir, "The Last Dance" draws heavily on behind-the-scenes footage shot at the time, by an NBA Entertainment film crew allowed to chronicle the team throughout the season. There are also tantalizing glimpses of such things as Jordan and Magic Johnson trash-talking during a "Dream Team" practice game, or inside the locker room at an NBA All-Star Game, as Jordan and others snipe about a young ball hog on the opposing team name Kobe Bryant. (Bryant and Jordan later became close, and the late Lakers star is among those featured.)
The current interviews -- from practically every basketball luminary imaginable -- are almost as good as the archival bounty. As further proof the filmmakers spoke to pretty much everybody, the documentary includes two former presidents: Bill Clinton, who reminisces about seeing Pippen play as a collegiate star in Arkansas; and Barack Obama, reflecting on Jordan regarding both his impact in Chicago and as an African American in the public spotlight, comparing him to Oprah Winfrey and Obama himself.In some respects, "The Last Dance" exists to remind the world of Jordan's greatness, and the level of stardom and adulation that surrounded him. That said, it's hardly a whitewash, underscoring the nasty streak that accompanied his drive for greatness.</p>
</div>
<div class="area area615">
  <div class="peo"></div>
  <p> We see Jordan as a rookie -- joining a franchise that, we're told, was drawing fewer fans than indoor soccer -- talk about lifting the Bulls to a level rivaling the Lakers and Celtics, then hear Magic and Larry Bird marvel about Jordan's astonishing 63-point performance against the Celtics in the 1986 playoffs.
Jordan also discusses how pre-title criticism that he was a great individual player but not a winner "ate at me." Still, in regard to his scoring feats Jordan muses that while there's no "I" in team, "There's an 'I' in win."For all the basketball highlights, there's so much more going on here that even an NBA fan who lived through those years might not remember it all. That ranges from Pippen fuming about being underpaid to all of Rodman's outlandish antics to the murder of Jordan's father, and media coverage that probed whether the tragedy was somehow linked to revelations about Michael Jordan's gambling habit.</p>
</div>
<div class="area area618">
  <div class="peo2"></div>
  <p> To those who recall what it meant to "Be like Mike" (cue the jingle), "The Last Dance" is an intoxicating trip into the way-back machine. More broadly, though, the project is a thoughtful look at the costs associated with stardom and how they've evolved in the modern sports era, particularly in the NBA.
Jordan wasn't the first hugely popular athlete, but like Magic and Bird, he became the image-conscious league's most powerful ambassador, with all the weight and expectations that entailed.<br>
Jordan, notably, in the present-day interviews repeats his stance that basketball should have been enough, explaining his reluctance to venture beyond it. As a famous example, the documentary considers his failure to publicly support North Carolina Senate candidate Harvey Gantt, an African American who ran against the notoriously racist Jesse Helms in 1990. A 1995 book reported that Jordan told friends, "Republicans buy sneakers too," a quote he has disputed.</p>
</div>
<div class="area area620">
  <div class="peo3"></div>
  <p> ESPN will schedule two episodes each Sunday over five weeks (with an edited version, minus the profanity, on ESPN2), providing a welcome infusion of original programming on the network. It ranks among the channel's best documentary efforts since "O.J.: Made in America," an even more ambitious 10-part exercise.<br>
As "The Last Dance" reminds us, this isn't the first time that Jordan and company have been a boon to ESPN and the sports world. And if it's not the same thrill as a live buzzer-beater for basketball fans, it's the next best dance partner one could hope to find.
"The Last Dance" premieres April 19 at 9 p.m. ET on ESPN. It's available outside the US beginning April 20 on Netflix.</p>
